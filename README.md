# Meshtastic-protobufs

The protobuf definitions for the meshtastic project (used by apps and the device code)

For questions on using these protobufs please post in our [forum](meshtastic.discourse.group).  We are friendly and we love people building/extending this work.

For autogenerated documentation (extracted from the .proto files) see [here](docs/docs.md).
