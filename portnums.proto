/** 
  For any new 'apps' that run on the device or via sister apps on phones/PCs they should pick and use a
  unique 'portnum' for their application.

  If you are making a new app using meshtastic, please send in a pull request to add your 'portnum' to this
  master table.  PortNums should be assigned in the following range:

  0-63   Core Meshtastic use, do not use for third party apps
  64-127 Registered 3rd party apps, send in a pull request that adds a new entry to portnums.proto to 
         register your application
  256-512 Use one of these portnums for your private applications that you don't want to register publically

  All other values are reserved.

  Note: This was formerly a Type enum named 'typ' with the same id #
  
  We have change to this 'portnum' based scheme for specifying app handlers for particular payloads.  
  This change is backwards compatible by treating the legacy OPAQUE/CLEAR_TEXT values identically.
